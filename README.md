For course operating system assignment 2
Create a CPU scheduler that compare with baseline to schedule the tasks
Baseline is a combination of Round Robin and priority algorithm
The implementated scheduler is multi-level queue algorithm but refined with compare the length of two queue( normal and high priority) that allows to move tasks in normal queue to high priority, in order to save the starvation problem.
